## API Setup

This project requires a mock API to function properly. The project uses JSON Server to simulate a backend API.

The mock API is defined in the `server.json` file and includes the following endpoints:

- `/coffees` - List of available coffees
- `/address` - Customer addresses
- `/payments` - Payment methods
- `/orders` - Customer orders

> **Important**: The project is configured to connect to the API at `http://localhost:3001`. You may need to modify the `baseURL` in `src/lib/axios.ts` to match your local network configuration.

Make sure to start the JSON Server before running the application using the `dev:server` script.
